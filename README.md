In the ALX Software Engineering program we learn by doing.
We work on projects every weekday that we have to push to github in order for an automatic review to be done on our projects.
This repository contains directories each corresponding to a system engineering or DevOps project.Thes projects are part of the 9 month long foundations curriculum.
In these projects we cover everything from the Basics of the Linux Shell, Bash scripting, Networking, APIs, Web-stack Debugging to more advanced topics.
